## üìå Project Highlights

- Combines **LightFM** (hybrid model) with **Content-Based Filtering** and **User-Product Similarity Scores**.
- Handles **Cold Start** problems via fallback logic.
- Supports **Top-N Ranking**, **Similarity Search**, and **Personalized Recommendations**.
- Designed for scalability using modular pipeline architecture.
